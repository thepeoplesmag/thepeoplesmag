<section class="part6">
<p>Greetings fellow writers and artists! I am a natural born ginger who is slowly sucking up the souls around me as I move through life winging it until I'm forced to make an actual plan. So far this non-plan has worked out in that I'm teaching English in China and experiencing a different lifestyle than I'm used to. I enjoy terrorizing children and teaching them non-offensive slang while trying to start a writing club at the school I'm working at.</p></section>

<h4 class="deck2 large-3">Andrea Walker</h4>
<section class="part6">
<p>Hey team! My name is Andy. I got bored of looking at lakes in Michigan, so I replanted myself in smog city. I spend my time gesticulating at street vendors, missing my cat (Dionysus), and searching for vegetarian food. As poet and short story writer, I know how hard is it to find your voice in a sea of strangers when you can’t master the third tone—so I decided to do something about it. The clumsy, ephemeral (and yet, still delightful) struggle of twenty-somethingdom and expatdom needs to be chronicled—and we’re here to help!</p></section>

<h4 class="deck2 large-3">Marie McGrath</h4>
<section class="part6">
<p>Oh hello! Didn't see you there. I'm Marie 23 year old nomad currently nesting in Beijing. Outside writing and reading writing, my hobbies include making pancakes, Beyonc karake, overpacking for weekend getaways and hate-stalking Kylie Jenner on Instagram (and then feeling moderately guilty about it).</p></section>
