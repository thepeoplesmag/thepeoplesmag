   <h1>Submission Guidlines</h1>
      <h5>The in-detail bit</h5>
      <section>
      <p>
        The People’s Mag is currently accepting submissions for art, poetry, nonfiction and fiction. We accept simultaneous submissions, but ask to be notified immediately if the work is accepted elsewhere. </p>
       <p>
        What we are looking for is anything at the moment. Like a radio, we’re still trying to find our station as we navigate these strange lands. 
      </p>
        <p>
        We ask that all prose is no longer than 5000 words and to not submit more than 5 poems at a time. We also ask that submissions be sent via an attachment of .doc or .rtf. 
      </p>
        <p>
        We accept all forms of art as long as it can be digitalized. All art should be at least 200dpi and be saved as a .pdf or .png. You may submit up to 5 pieces at any one time.
      </p>
        <p>
        For the subject, please state what kind of creative piece you are sending to us. In the body of the email, please state your name, word count or the number of poems or number of art pieces, and the title of the work(s). Please send all submissions to submit.pm2.5@outlook.com.
      </p>
        <p>
        We may ask for little changes, but will not publish anything not approved by the author. For the pieces we accept, we ask for “first North American serial rights,” which means that we will post your creative baby only on this website and in the .pdf compilation. All rights thereafter revert back to you, the author. We ask that you give us at least a month to respond to submissions before starting to email us about if you were accepted or not. 
      </p>
        <p>
        We unfortunately are not able to pay authors at this time. We will be sending a finished .pdf book to every author and artist that is accepted for that particular run. 
      </p>
       <p>
        Thank you for your time, we hope to hear from you soon.
